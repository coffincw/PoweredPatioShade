# PoweredPatioShade
Multi-functional powered shade for a porch or patio which allows the owner to pick different modes including: Manual, Manual-Reel, Automatic.  These modes can be selected by using switch 1 and two at the base of the fan.  If the switches are both in the off position, the shade is suspended and considered off. 


## Functions
These three modes allow the shade owner to be able to tailor their individual shade experience based on their wants and needs.
1. Manual (Button): *Switch 1:* **ON** *Switch 2:* **OFF**
    - If switch 1 is on and switch 2 is off the shade is in Manual mode where the owner can open and close the shade using the button at the base of the shade.
2. Manual-Reel (Potentiometer): *Switch 1:* **OFF** *Switch 2:* **ON**
    - If switch 1 is off and switch 2 is on the shade is in Manual-Reel mode where the owner can control the position of the shade using the potentiometer. This allows the owner to have the shade open an arbitrary percentage like 50% or 30% to get just the right amount of shade.
3. Automatic (Light Sensing): *Switch 1:* **ON** *Switch 2:* **ON**
    - If both switches are on the shade is in Automatic mode where the owner simply can sit down and relax while the shade opens when it's sunny out and closes when the sun goes behind the clouds or the sun begins to set.

## How to run
Simply plug in the LPC1768 chip and select one of the modes outlined in the project description.

## What I learned
This project taught me a lot about circuits and mbed. Specifically, I learned a lot about servos, resistors, button debouncing, and photocell resistors. I learned how to interface each with mbed and send/receive data from different pieces of hardware via the LPC1768 pins. I also learned a bit about making something structurally sound as I had some difficulty constructing the fan after getting all the technology working.
